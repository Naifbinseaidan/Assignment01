Tabuk Region is home of some of the jewels of Saudi Arabia, both natural and historical. Some of the most prominent natural features of Tabuk Province are: the majestic sandstone formations originating from the Wadi Rum in Jordan and crossing the whole region towards the south; the Sarawat mountains peaking over 2500 meters above sea level; the volcanoes of the Harrat Al-Uwayrid; and the beaches and coral reefs of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba.

On the historical side, Tabuk Province is famous for its ancient rock art, its ancient oasis on the frankincense trade road, its glorious stories of prophets, its epic battles, its pilgrimage roads, and the Hejaz Railway whose fate was told in the book and the movie “Lawrence of Arabia”.
